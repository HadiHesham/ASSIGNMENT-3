# ASSIGNMENT-3
my screenshot shows my mechnaics file and customers file
the output shows that omar appointment was declined since all mechanics had appointments at his requested time which is 5:30
ali took appointment with Marwan since both Mai and loay had appointments at 1:15
mariam took appointment with Mai since Mai had no appontment at 1:30 and Mai is the first considered mechanic
seif took an appointment with loay at 3:15 since Mai had an appointment at 3:15 and loay is a higher piriority mechanic than Marwan. The first mechanic checked is Mai then loay then Marwan
hadi took an appointment with Mai aince she had no appointment at 7:30 and Mai is the first considered mechanic
I then sorted my customers array which contained info about customer and their appointment times inascending order of appointment times and i filtered out any customer who had their appointment cancelled like omar
Lastly, I enqueued all my customers names, appointment times and assigned mechanic names into my circular queue so my queue was sorted in asscending order of appointment times.
Lastly, i displayed the circular queue elements
